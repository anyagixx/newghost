## Burst Detection Tuning

Burst thresholds are deployment-time tuning values, not architecture constants.

Default guidance:

- `alert_threshold = 50`
  Use `10` for single-user or local development environments.
- `alert_window_secs = 1`
  Keeps short spikes visible without alerting on isolated failures.
- `min_log_interval_secs = 5`
  Limits sustained burst logging to at most 12 entries per minute.

Tune after observing real traffic for 24 hours:

1. If `peak_rate_per_sec` never exceeds `10`, lower `alert_threshold`.
2. If `peak_rate_per_sec` regularly exceeds the threshold during normal load, raise it.
3. If `intent_queue_len / intent_queue_capacity` stays above `0.8`, increase queue capacity before loosening burst alerts.
4. If `total_rejected` remains `0`, keep defaults and avoid unnecessary tuning.

Key metrics:

- `peak_rate_per_sec`
- `intents_rejected_queue_full`
- `intent_queue_len`
- `intent_queue_capacity`

Operational rule:

- Tune thresholds first.
- Increase queue capacity second.
- Treat repeated queue saturation as a capacity problem, not only a logging problem.
